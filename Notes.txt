Approximately it took me a bit more of 2 working days to finish the challenge, taking into account that I had to
work on it in small several occasions due to my schedule.

Some notes about the final result, on one side there is room for improvements:

* In general I dedicated the minimal time to the UI as I wanted to focus on the business logic and tests:
    * There's no handle for loading, empty nor error states in the views.
    * Ui could be improved a lot with animations, better styling, etc.
    * Tests are not there as there's a minimum amount of states, nonetheless some espresso could be written to
    test view states by mocking the presenter.
* There are some comments included in the code to express possible improvements and explanations on the
implementation.

On the other side, some decisions made:

* I wanted to mix some MVP(ish) architecture with some functional goodies, including Rx chains. It would
be interesting to discuss the pros and cons of the approach or how could it scale in a larger app.
* I decided not to go the Dagger-Retrofit way as given the size of the project it would be easy to create
wrappers around the specifics and replace with any other lib if the project necessities change.
